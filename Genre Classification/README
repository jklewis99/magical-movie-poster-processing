There are 4 modes when running the code (REQUIRED)
1. 'python main.py train' will start loading data, creating neural network model, and training the model
2. 'python main.py predict' will predict the genres based on the image 
3. 'python main.py find_threshold' will output and save the graph accuracy vs threshold under the name 'evaluation.png'
4. 'python main.py class_activation_map' will create a class activation map on the image

There are 3 types of model when running the code (REQUIRED)
1. 'python main.py --model=1' will select NasNetLarge model
2. 'python main.py --model=2' will select InceptionResNetV2 model
3. 'python main.py --model=3' will select Xception model

When selecting the 'train', there are 2 training modes (default is 1)
1. 'python main.py --train_mode=1' will train with the new model
2. 'python main.py --train_mode=2' will train with the existing model

When selecting the 'predict' or 'class_activation_map', '--path' is representing the path of the image

Examples of Command:
'python main.py train --model=1 --train_mode=1' will create and train a new NasNetLarge model
'python main.py predict --model=1 --path=test.jpg' will use NasNetLarge model (assuming the model has been trained) to predict the image called 'test.jpg'
'python main.py class_activation_map --model=1 --path=test.jpg' will use NasNetLarge model (assuming the model has been trained) to create a class activation map on the image called 'test.jpg'
'python main.py find_threshold --model=1' will use NasNetLarge model (assuming the model has been trained) to find the threshold (confidence level)
